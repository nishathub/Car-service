1. Install jsonwebtoken
2. jwt.sign(payload, secret, {expriresIn: }) // backend sendJWT function
3. client side login page POST JWT after successful login 
4. create secret token via server terminal: 
node - enter
require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex') - enter
thus generate a large key
5. store the key in the .env file and use it on the function through process.env.key

that was all about generating , sending JWT

Now, we need to store the key to the client browser http only cookie
there are 3 ways to store key, memory, local storage and cookie, cookie is the best way

to do so : 

1. install cookie parser
2. Now, set up cookie program in the sendJWT function (look there for syntax and comments)
we need to set http only (why ? ask chatGPT)
3. CORS 
the cors setting is very simple, just like suggested by cGPT earlier, even simpler than that.
we just need to put some settings inside the () of cors - 
origin: ['http://localhost:5173', 'http://www.ourWebsiteHostLink.com'],
credentials: true,
methods: ['OPTIONS', 'POST', 'GET', 'PATCH', 'PUT', 'DELETE'], // Ensure all necessary methods are allowed
allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type'],

among these 4, p.Hero suggested only first two.

4. Client side axios setting
